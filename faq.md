Q: Why is the [browser](http://grapal.allenai.org:7474/browser/) prompting me to use `server connect` and saying the databse is not available?

A: GrapAL is not accessible on wifi networks that block VPN access. We are working to resolve the issue, however for now try accessing it on a different network.




Q: Does GrapAL contain all data from [SemanticScholar.org](SemanticScholar.org)?

A: GrapAL is a static snapshot of Semantic Scholar, updated at a monthly cadence. The current snapshot is from 1/28/2019.
